### Retrospectives
#### _What are Retrospectives?_



### Retrospectives

Retrospectives are practice used by their teams to **reflect** on their way of working, and **continuously become better** in what they do. They are meant to help teams **keep improving.**

<!-- {_class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1"} --> **- 12th Principle of the Agile Manifesto -**



### Retrospectives
#### _Why use a Retrospective?_

**Teams do not have them**

_So they never improve_

OR  

**Teams have them**

_But they are done poorly and teams do not follow up on identified items_



### Retrospectives

### Retrospectives
_The Retrospective Prime Directive_

**"Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone
did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and
abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand."**

-Norm Kerth, Project Retrospectives: A Handbook for Team Review



### Retrospectives
#### _The Retrospective Safety Check_

- Ask participants to choose a number between 1 and 5 that indicates how safe they feel within the group.
  - 5 - *No Problem, I’ll talk about anything*
  - 1 - *I’ll smile and be calm; everything is great and agree with the managers*
- The numbers should be taken anonymously.
- Acknowledge the result and decide what’s next...



### Exercise - Daily Retrospective

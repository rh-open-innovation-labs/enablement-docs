```

8. Download and uncompress the OpenShift 3.11 client binary archive. Copy the ***oc*** binary to ***/usr/local/bin*** folder on your system

```bash
curl -L -O https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/oc/4.5/macosx/oc.tar.gz
tar xzvf oc.tar.gz
cp oc /usr/local/bin/
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/oc
```

### Microsoft Windows

You will be adding several directories to the ***PATH*** environment variable. Follow the instructions at https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/ to edit the ***PATH*** environment variable on Windows 10.

1. Download the Node.js 8.x LTS Windows 64-bit binary archive file from https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v8.x/. The binary will be named as ***node-v8.x.y-win-x64.zip***, where 'x' and 'y' indicates the major and minor version of the latest Node.js 8 LTS release. 

2. Extract the zip file archive under a suitable folder in the ***C:\*** drive, for example ***C:\nodejs***. Make sure that your directory name does not have any spaces in it.

3. Add the directory where you uncompressed the zip file to the ***PATH*** environment variable, so that the ***node.exe*** and ***npm.cmd*** executable files are available in the system path.

4. Install JDK version 1.8 for Windows 64-bit by using the installer from the Oracle website at https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html

Ensure that you install the JDK into a directory which has no spaces in its name, for example ***C:\Java***. Add a new environment variable called ***JAVA_HOME*** which points to the top level directory where you installed the JDK.

5. Add the ***JAVA_HOME\bin*** directory to the ***PATH*** environment variable, so that the ***java.exe*** and ***javac.exe*** executable files are available in the system path.

6. Install Google Chrome version 70 or higher by downloading it from https://google.com/chrome

7. Install Docker for Windows by following the instructions from https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows. Before downloading, you will be asked to create an account. Register and download Docker for Windows.

Ensure that you install Docker into a directory which has no spaces in its name, for example ***C:\Docker***. You will be prompted to enable Hyper-V during installation.

Windows will restart a couple of times after enabling Hyper-V and continue with the Docker installation. Follow the instructions provided in the link above to test and verify your Docker installation.

7. Download and install Git for Windows by using the 64-bit installer from https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.20.0.windows.1/Git-2.20.0-64-bit.exe.

8. Follow the instructions at https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git#windows to install and verify your Git installation. Ensure that you install Git into a directory which has no spaces in its name, for example ***C:\Git***.

<p class="tip">
<b>NOTE</b> - Ensure that the <i>Git Bash</i> component is selected during installation. You will need this to run bash shell scripts during the execution of lab exercises.
</p>

9. Download and install Atom text editor from https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/download/v1.33.0/AtomSetup-x64.exe, or Visual Studio Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=win64

10. You will use a custom container image for running OpenShift client commands, and Ansible playbooks. You will map a directory on your local Windows system containing Ansible playbooks to a directory inside the container, and run the Ansible playbooks from within the container.

11. Execute the following commands in the ***Windows Command Prompt*** to run Ansible playbooks on Windows systems:

* Pull the container image containing the tools and utilities that are required for running Ansible playbooks:

```bash
docker pull quay.io/redhat/do500-toolbox
```

* Create a working directory under your ***C:\*** drive to store the lab exercise files and Ansible playbooks

```bash
mkdir C:\do500-workspace
```

* Launch the container and run a quick test:

```bash
docker run -it -v C:/do500-workspace:/home/tool-box/workarea:Z quay.io/redhat/do500-toolbox /bin/bash
```

<p class="tip">
<b>NOTE</b> - When you launch the container for the very first time, you will be prompted by Docker, as well as the Windows security subsystem to allow read and write access to the ***C:\do500-workspace*** directory. Allow read and write access to this directory by entering your Windows username and password when prompted.
</p>

* Once you are inside the container, you can log in to the OpenShift cluster using the OpenShift ***oc*** command-line client, and verify that Ansible is installed:

```bash
bash-4.4$ oc login -u <username> -p <password> <CLUSTER_URL>
bash-4.4$ oc version
bash-4.4$ ansible --version
bash-4.4$ exit
```

Your instructor will provide the ***username*** and ***password*** information for the OpenShift cluster when you are ready to run the lab exercises.
